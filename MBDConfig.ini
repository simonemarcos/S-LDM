# Config file for Misbehaviour Detector

# MBD has internal default values equal to the ones used in this file
# Remove the # in front of each line and change value to customize the configuration

# General options for some calculations of detection
[OPTIONS]
    # If this option is true position related checks Haversine distance formula will be used instead of Euclidean formula
    # UseHaversine = false

    # Set the tolerance % to be used in checks
    # This tolerance doesn't apply to threshold checks but to inconsistency checks so low tolerances may result in constant detections
    # Tolerance = 10

    # Set the maximum time in seconds that can pass before two messages are not considered consecutive for inconsistency checks
    # MaxTimeForConsecutive = 1.0

    # If this option is true security checks are ignored
    # IgnoreSecurity = false


# ABOUT THRESHOLDS
# The units used for thresholds are the same for general and station type specific and are the following:
    # MaxSpeed : [km/h] kilometer per hour
    # MaxAcceleration : [m/s^2] meter per squared second
    # MaxBraking : [m/s^2] meter per squared second
    # MaxCurvature : [m^-1] 1 over 10000 meter
    # MaxYawRate : [Â°/s] degree per second

# General thresholds are the defaults used on every stationType if no stationType specific threshold is set
