# ABOUT THRESHOLDS
# The units used for thresholds are the same for general and station type specific and are the following:
    # MaxSpeed : [km/h] kilometer per hour
    # MaxAcceleration : [m/s^2] meter per squared second
    # MaxBraking : [m/s^2] meter per squared second
    # MaxCurvature : [m^-1] 1 over 10000 meter
    # MaxYawRate : [Â°/s] degree per second

# General thresholds are the defaults used on every stationType if no stationType specific threshold is set
[GENERAL_THRESHOLDS]
